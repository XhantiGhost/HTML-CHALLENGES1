      Coding is super amazing!! in all my life i never knew i would enjoy something this much.
      I mean it is super challenging so far, which is good I mean who whats to do something that is not challenging at all?
      so to tell you guys what i have learned so far...
      We did HTML and i mean the entire HTML content in just 6 days which is hectic but also fun. don't be intimedidated by that
      its so crazy, intense and fun at the same time.
